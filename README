# Student Attendance System

A simple Python-based student attendance system that reads and writes student attendance data from an Excel file using `openpyxl` and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with `tkinter` for scanning or entering student barcodes (IDs).

## Features

- **Dynamic Column Detection:**  
  Automatically detects the "id", "name", and "pa" columns based on the header row in the Excel file.

- **Attendance Marking:**  
  Searches for a student ID in the Excel file and, if found, marks the student's attendance as "Present" in the corresponding "pa" column.

- **Student Name Retrieval:**  
  Retrieves and displays the student's name in a confirmation message upon marking attendance.

- **User-friendly GUI:**  
  Provides a simple GUI for inputting student barcodes/IDs.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x  
- [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/)  
- [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository or download the script files.**

2. **Install the required Python package (`openpyxl`) using pip:**

   ```bash
   pip install openpyxl
   ```

3. **Ensure that your Excel file is named `Students.xlsx` and is located in the same directory as the script.**

## Excel File Structure

The Excel file (`Students.xlsx`) should contain a header row (row 1) with the following columns:

- **id**: Student ID (used to search for the student)  
- **name**: Student Name (used to display the student's name on the GUI)  
- **pa**: Attendance (this column will be updated to "Present" when a student is marked as present)

Example:

| id    | name          | pa       |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| 1001  | John Doe      |          |
| 1002  | Jane Smith    |          |
| 1003  | Bob Johnson   |          |

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**

   Execute the Python script (e.g., `A.py`) from your command line or Python IDE:

   ```bash
   python A.py
   ```

2. **Mark Attendance:**

   - A GUI window will appear prompting you to "Scan or Enter Student Barcode:".
   - Enter the student ID in the input field and click the **Submit** button.
   - If the student ID is found in the Excel file, the script will mark the student as "Present" in the "pa" column and display the student's name in a confirmation message.
   - If the student ID is not found, an error message will be displayed.

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Error:**  
  If you encounter a `PermissionError` while saving the Excel file, make sure that `Students.xlsx` is not open in any other application (like Excel) when running the script.

- **Missing Headers:**  
  Ensure that the Excel file has the required headers (`id`, `name`, `pa`) in the first row.
